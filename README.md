# ColorManga

ColorManga is a Python project that allows you to convert black-and-white manga PDFs into colorized versions using artistic image colorization techniques. It combines various open-source libraries and tools to automate the process of extracting images from the PDF, colorizing them, and then combining the colorized images back into a new PDF file.

## Features

- Convert PDF files containing manga pages into individual image files
- Colorize the extracted manga pages using an artistic image colorization model
- Combine the colorized images back into a new PDF file
